## Branching and Workflow

We follow **Gitflow Workflow** for streamlined collaboration and project maintenance. Please follow these conventions:

### Branch Naming Convention

- **Main Branch**: `main` – Production-ready code.
- **Development Branch**: `develop` – Integration branch for ongoing work.
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/<feature-name>` – For new features.
  - Example: `feature/photo-filter`
- **Bugfix Branches**: `bugfix/<description>` – For bug fixes.
  - Example: `bugfix/fix-crash-on-save`
- **Release Branches**: `release/<version>` – For preparing a release.
  - Example: `release/v1.0.0`
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/<description>` – For critical fixes in production.
  - Example: `hotfix/emergency-crash-fix`

### Workflow Guidelines

1. **Creating a Branch**: Start each feature or fix from `develop`.
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
   ```

2. **Commit Messages**: Use structured, clear messages:
   - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
   - Example: `feat(camera): add burst photo mode`

3. **Push Changes**: Push your branch and open a pull request.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/<feature-name>
   ```

4. **Pull Request (PR) Guidelines**:
   - Title and description should be clear.
   - Ensure tests pass before requesting a review.
   - Require at least two approvals before merging.

5. **Merging**:
   - Feature branches merge into `develop`.
   - Release branches merge into `main` for production releases.
   - Use **Squash and Merge** for a clean commit history.

6. **Release Process**:
   - Create a `release/<version>` branch for new versions.
   - Test thoroughly, then merge into `main` and tag the release.
