## Branching and Workflow

This project follows the **Gitflow Workflow** for better collaboration and version control. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

### Branch Naming Convention

- **Main Branch**: `main` – The stable, production-ready branch.
- **Development Branch**: `develop` – The integration branch for feature branches.
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/<feature-name>` – For new features or enhancements.
  - Example: `feature/user-authentication`
- **Bugfix Branches**: `bugfix/<bug-description>` – For fixing bugs.
  - Example: `bugfix/fix-login-issue`
- **Release Branches**: `release/<version>` – For preparing a release.
  - Example: `release/1.0.0`
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/<description>` – For critical fixes in production.
  - Example: `hotfix/urgent-login-fix`

### Workflow Guidelines

1. **Creating a Branch**: Create a new branch from `develop` for new features or `main` for hotfixes.
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
   ```

2. **Commit Messages**: Follow a structured format for commits:
   - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
   - Example: `feat(authentication): add JWT token-based authentication`

3. **Push Changes**: Push your branch to the remote repository and open a pull request when ready.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/<feature-name>
   ```

4. **Pull Request (PR) Guidelines**:
   - Title: Descriptive and concise.
   - Description: Include a summary of changes, references to related issues, and any notes for reviewers.
   - Review: At least two approvals are required before merging.
   - CI/CD: Ensure all tests pass before requesting a review.

5. **Merging**:
   - Merge feature branches into `develop`.
   - Merge `develop` into `main` for releases.
   - Use **Squash and Merge** to keep commit history clean.

6. **Release Process**:
   - Create a `release/<version>` branch.
   - Test and verify all features.
   - Merge `release/<version>` into `main` and tag the version.
